Hello, I am Jens. I am 26 years old and I come from a small town called "Nordenham" in Germany. This town is not far from Hamburg.
I studied Human-Computer interaction for 3 years at Hamburg University before coming to Japan. I like doing sports (Jogging, Swimming and Krav Maga), animals (especially tapir, seal and goat) and going to an izakaya. 
In the following, I present an ASCII-tapir.

                    ,'   e                    ))
                   (  .='__,                  ,
                    `~`     `-\  /._____,/   /
                             | | )    (  (   ;
