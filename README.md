Hello, I am Jens. I come from a small town called "Nordenham" in Germany. This town is not far from Hamburg.
I studied Human-Computer interaction for 3 yeras at Hamburg University before coming to Japan. I like doing sports (Jogging, Swimming and Krav Maga), animals (especially tapir, seal and goat) and going to an izakaya.
